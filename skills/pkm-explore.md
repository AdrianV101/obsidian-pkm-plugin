# PKM Explore — Knowledge Discovery and Gap Analysis

Use this skill to understand what the vault already knows about a topic before creating new notes or doing research. Combines graph traversal with semantic search to find both explicit connections and hidden relationships.

**When to use**: "What does the vault know about X?", "Find related notes to Y", exploring a topic area before writing.
**When NOT to use**: Routine session-start context loading (the SessionStart hook handles that automatically).

## Step 1: Identify Seed Note

Find the most relevant existing note for the topic:

```
vault_semantic_search({ query: "<topic>", limit: 5 })
```

- If the user specified a note path, use that directly as the seed
- Otherwise, pick the highest-scoring result as the seed
- If **no relevant notes** exist (all scores < 0.3), report that the vault has minimal coverage and suggest creating a seed note using pkm-create

## Step 2: Graph Context

Explore the structural neighborhood around the seed note:

```
vault_neighborhood({ path: "<seed-note-path>", depth: 2, direction: "both" })
```

This reveals the **intentional** knowledge structure — what someone explicitly linked.

## Step 3: Semantic Expansion

Search for conceptually related notes that may not be in the graph:

```
vault_semantic_search({ query: "<topic>", limit: 10 })
```

If `vault_semantic_search` is unavailable (no `OPENAI_API_KEY`), use `vault_search` with multiple keyword variations and `vault_query` with relevant tags.

## Step 4: Gap Analysis

Compare the graph results (step 2) with semantic results (step 3):

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| In graph AND semantic | Well-connected, established knowledge | No action needed |
| In graph but NOT semantic | Structurally linked but topically distant | May indicate weak/outdated link |
| **In semantic but NOT graph** | **Missing links** — conceptually related but unconnected | **Highest-value findings** — suggest linking |

## Step 5: Synthesize

Present findings to the user organized as:

1. **What exists**: Key notes on this topic with brief summaries (type, status, tags)
2. **How it's connected**: Graph structure — which notes link to which, at what depth
3. **Missing links**: Semantically related notes not yet in the graph (candidates for linking)
4. **Knowledge gaps**: Topics referenced but not covered by any note — candidates for new notes via pkm-create
