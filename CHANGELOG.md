# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- `pkm-mcp-server init` now correctly registers the MCP server with Claude Code via `claude mcp add` instead of writing to the wrong config file (`~/.claude/settings.json`). Previously, the server appeared to register successfully but was never visible to Claude Code.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `pkm-mcp-server init` — interactive onboarding wizard that walks users through vault setup, template installation, folder structure, OpenAI API key configuration, and Claude Code registration in a single session
- `cli.js` — new CLI dispatcher with `init` and `--version` subcommands; existing MCP server behavior unchanged when run without arguments
- `templates/note.md` — minimal generic note template for users who prefer to define their own templates
- 36 unit tests for init wizard helpers

### Changed
- `index.js` refactored to export `startServer()` for CLI dispatcher (backward compatible — `node index.js` still works)
- Entry point updated from `index.js` to `cli.js` in package.json (`bin`, `main`, `exports`)

### Dependencies
- Added `@inquirer/prompts` for interactive CLI prompts

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- CI workflow for automated npm publishing via GitHub releases (OIDC trusted publishing, no tokens)

### Fixed
- Hook setup instructions now included in main README Quick Start (previously only in `hooks/README.md`, invisible on npm)
- `hooks/` directory added to architecture file tree in README

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `vault_capture` tool — signal a PKM-worthy capture (decision, task, research, bug); returns immediately while a background hook creates the note
- PKM hook scripts for Claude Code integration:
  - SessionStart hook (`session-start.js`) — loads project context from vault automatically
  - PostToolUse hook (`capture-handler.sh`) — spawns Sonnet agent for explicit `vault_capture` calls
  - Stop hook (`stop-sweep.sh`) — spawns Haiku agent for passive decision/task sweep at session end
- Enum validation for task `status` (pending/active/done/cancelled) and `priority` (low/normal/high/urgent) fields in `vault_write` and `vault_update_frontmatter` — non-task note types are unaffected

### Changed
- `sqlite-vec` upgraded from pinned alpha (0.1.7-alpha.2) to stable release (0.1.7)
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` updated to 1.27.1
- `better-sqlite3` updated to 12.8.0

### Security
- Resolved 7 transitive dependency vulnerabilities (hono, @hono/node-server, ajv, express-rate-limit, flatted, minimatch, qs)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- `vault_peek` heading outline now displays as an indented tree instead of a flat list — hierarchy is conveyed by 2-space indentation per level, `#` markers stripped
- `vault_peek` heading outline no longer includes line number prefixes (`L13`, `L15`, etc.)
- `vault_peek` size line now always includes chunk count (e.g. "1 chunk", "3 chunks") instead of showing a separate `**Chunks:**` line only for multi-chunk files

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- MCP server with 18 tools for Obsidian vault interaction
- `vault_read` with pagination support (heading-based, tail lines, tail sections, chunk, line range); auto-redirects large files (>80k chars) to peek data; `force` param to bypass redirect (hard-capped at ~400k chars)
- `vault_peek` for inspecting file metadata and structure without reading full content (size, frontmatter, indented heading tree, preview)
- `vault_write` with template-based note creation enforcing YAML frontmatter
- `vault_append` with positional insert (after heading, before heading, end of section)
- `vault_edit` for surgical single-occurrence string replacement
- `vault_update_frontmatter` — safe, atomic YAML frontmatter field updates (set, create, delete fields with protected required fields)
- `vault_search` for full-text search across markdown files
- `vault_semantic_search` using OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` embeddings with SQLite-vec storage
- `vault_suggest_links` for smart link discovery based on content similarity
- `vault_list` and `vault_recent` for directory listing and recently modified files
- `vault_links` for wikilink analysis (`[[...]]` syntax)
- `vault_neighborhood` for graph context exploration via BFS wikilink traversal
- `vault_query` for querying notes by YAML frontmatter metadata (type, status, tags, dates, custom fields, sorting)
- `vault_tags` for tag discovery with per-note counts, folder scoping, and glob patterns
- `vault_activity` for cross-session memory via activity logging with session IDs
- `vault_trash` — soft-delete to `.trash/` (Obsidian convention) with broken incoming link warnings
- `vault_move` — move/rename files with automatic wikilink updating across vault
- Fuzzy path resolution for read-only tools (resolve by basename, `.md` extension optional)
- Fuzzy folder resolution for search/query/tags/recent tools (partial name matching)
- 12 Obsidian note templates (project index, ADR, devlog, permanent note, research note, troubleshooting log, fleeting note, literature note, meeting notes, map of content, daily note, task)
- Sample `CLAUDE.md` for integrating PKM workflows into code repositories
- Background `fs.watch` indexer for keeping semantic search index fresh
- Metadata schema documentation (`06-System/metadata-schema.md`)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow
- Comprehensive test suite (417 tests) for helpers, handlers, graph module, and activity log
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- EditorConfig for consistent formatting
- Community files: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, LICENSE (MIT)

### Security
- Path traversal prevention on all vault operations
- Write tools require exact paths to prevent accidental modifications
- Ambiguous fuzzy path matches return errors instead of guessing
- Prototype pollution protection on frontmatter key validation (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` blocked)
- ReDoS vulnerability prevention in `vault_list` glob pattern — linear-time glob matching
- Atomic file creation in `vault_write` (`wx` flag) prevents race conditions
- Error messages sanitized to prevent leaking absolute vault paths
