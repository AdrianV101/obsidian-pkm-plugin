# Obsidian PKM Setup

You are configuring the Obsidian PKM plugin. Walk the user through these steps:

## Step 1: Vault Path

Ask the user for their Obsidian vault path. Validate that:
- The path exists and is a directory
- It contains at least one `.md` file
- Suggest `~/Documents/PKM` as a default

If the path is valid, add it to `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` block:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VAULT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/vault"
  }
}
```

Read the file first, merge with existing env vars (don't overwrite other settings), and write back. Verify the MCP server can connect after setting it.

## Step 2: OpenAI API Key (Optional)

Ask if they want semantic search features (vault_semantic_search, vault_suggest_links). If yes:

- **NEVER ask the user to type their API key in the chat** — it would be stored in conversation history
- Tell them to open `~/.claude/settings.json` in their text editor (outside of Claude Code) and add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `env` block:
  ```json
  {
    "env": {
      "VAULT_PATH": "/path/to/vault",
      "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-key-here"
    }
  }
  ```
- Explain they can get a key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Explain this enables 2 additional tools (semantic search + link suggestions) but is completely optional
- Tell them to restart Claude Code after saving the file

## Step 3: Verify Setup

Run these checks:
1. `echo $VAULT_PATH` — confirm it's set
2. Count `.md` files in the vault: `find "$VAULT_PATH" -name "*.md" | wc -l`
3. Check if templates exist: `ls "$VAULT_PATH/05-Templates/"` — if missing, offer to run `obsidian-pkm init` to scaffold the vault structure

## Step 4: Migration Check

Check if the old `pkm-mcp-server` is installed:
1. Run `npm list -g pkm-mcp-server --depth=0 2>/dev/null`
2. Check for stale hooks: `ls ~/.claude/hooks/pkm/ 2>/dev/null`

If found:
- Suggest: `npm uninstall -g pkm-mcp-server`
- Suggest removing `~/.claude/hooks/pkm/` directory (hooks are now managed by the plugin)
- Check `~/.claude/settings.json` for old hook entries and offer to clean them up

## Step 5: Done

Confirm setup is complete. Tell the user:
- "Your Obsidian PKM plugin is configured. Try asking me to list your vault folders to verify."
- If OPENAI_API_KEY was set: "Semantic search will build its index in the background on first use."
- **Important**: "Restart your Claude Code session for the MCP server to pick up the new environment variables."
