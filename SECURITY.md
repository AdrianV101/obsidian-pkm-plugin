## Scope

This project handles local file system access to an Obsidian vault. The main security considerations are:

- **Path traversal** -- The server validates all paths to prevent escaping the vault directory
- **SQL injection** -- All SQLite queries use parameterized statements
- **API keys** -- The `OBSIDIAN_PKM_OPENAI_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` fallback) is passed via environment variable, never stored in code or logs

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published version is actively maintained.
